   <h4 style="color: blue;"> Born and raised</h4>
   <p> Jalaluddin Rumi, commonly known as Rumi, was born on September 30, 1207, in Balkh, which is now in modern-day Afghanistan. He was raised in a family of theologians and scholars, and at the age of 12, he and his family fled the Mongol invasion, eventually settling in Konya, Turkey. Rumi grew up in an intellectually rich environment, which greatly influenced his later spiritual and poetic journey. He later became a prominent Islamic scholar and preacher in Konya.   </p>
   <h4 style="color: blue;"> Popularity </h4>
   <p> Rumi's popularity can be attributed to his extraordinary contributions to both Islamic mysticism (Sufism) and world literature. His poetry, particularly the Mathnawi and the Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi, has transcended cultural and religious boundaries, making him one of the most widely read and loved poets in the world. His words emphasize the universality of love, spirituality, and human connection, which resonates with people of diverse backgrounds. Rumi's profound insights into the human soul and his celebration of love have earned him a place as a timeless and revered figure.   </p>
   <h4 style="color: blue;"> Works of Rumi </h4>
   <p> Rumi's literary legacy is primarily associated with his poetic works. The "Mathnawi" is one of his most famous masterpieces, consisting of six volumes of poetry that explore themes of love, spirituality, and the human journey toward God. His "Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi" is a collection of odes and poems dedicated to his spiritual mentor, Shams Tabriz. Rumi's poetry beautifully combines Persian, Arabic, and Turkish influences and is known for its deep spiritual insights and metaphors. He also founded the Mevlevi Order, commonly known as the Whirling Dervishes, a Sufi order known for their mystical dance and devotion. Rumi's influence on Sufism and world literature is immeasurable, and his works continue to inspire and captivate readers worldwide.   </p>
